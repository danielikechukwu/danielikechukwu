# ðŸ‘‹ Hello welcome, I am [Daniel Ikechukwu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-ikechukwu-122000217/)

I am a passionate and results-driven Software Developer with expertise in building dynamic and scalable web applications using Angular, JavaScript, and TypeScript. With a strong foundation in front-end development, I craft user-friendly and efficient solutions that deliver exceptional user experiences and also worked with team developing a SaaS project deployed on Azure.

Beyond coding, I have hands-on experience with Azure DevOps, leveraging its tools to streamline productivity, ensure efficient CI/CD pipelines, and foster collaboration within development teams.
